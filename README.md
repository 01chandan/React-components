# React-components
This is a repository of React components that you can use for web applications, including shopping carts, forms, and other useful elements. 

# Aim of Repo
It's intended for anyone looking to submit assignments for internships or job applications, making the submission process easier. The goal is to create a repository showcasing my knowledge of React technology. I faced challenges in securing an internship due to limited time and large assignments. Therefore, I've already built some commonly used components to help others with their web app projects.

# Implementation
In this GitHub repository, I've incorporated React icons for adding graphical elements to the project. You can find these icons at this link. To integrate them into your standard modern project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

<br/>

**1. React Icons**
Website Link- [https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/]

```bash
npm install react-icons --save
```
<br/>

**2. Form submissions**
I've utilized React Hook Form. You can learn more about it and get started by visiting this link. The installation process is straightforward; just run the following command:
Website link- [https://react-hook-form.com/]

```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```
<br/>

Additionally, I've used **Tailwind CSS** to style the components in this repository. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps streamline the styling process.

**Feel free to explore and use these technologies in your own projects!**
